# MEAN-STACK
### I am developing my own MEAN stack which I would like to use for faster and consistent application development in my day-to-day life. 

It is a collection of 4 major technologies as listed below:

* MongoDB - MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable
* Express - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* AngularJS - based framework. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
* Node.js - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for easily building fast, scalable web and network applications.
